# **pps** Toolbox for CI direct stimulation #
**p**layer.**p**lay(**s**timulus)

This toolbox is meant to assist the design of cross-devices direct stimulation experiments in Matlab.

It is composed of:

1. Scripts to play sound uniformly across CI platforms: `player.play(stimulus)`.
Scripts are object-oriented, based on three Matlab super classes, `Player`, `Format` and `Stimulus`.
1. Demos.


## How do I get set up? ##

* run `ppsToolboxStartup`.
* check the demos in the `demos` folder.

## Where can I get help? ##

There is a `demos` folder inside the repository. You are also welcome to ask questions
on the [issue tracking page](https://github.com/fguerit/pps-toolbox/issues).

## Changelog ##

Changes can be tracked in the [changelog.md](changelog.md) file.
