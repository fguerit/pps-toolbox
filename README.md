# **pps** Toolbox for CI direct stimulation#
**p**layer.**p**lay(**s**timulus)

This toolbox is meant to assist the design of cross-devices direct stimulation experiments in Matlab.

It is composed of:

1. Scripts to play sound uniformly across CI platforms: `player.play(stimulus)`.
Scripts are object-oriented, based on three Matlab super classes, `Player`, `Medium` and `Stimulus`.
1. A fitting interface `loudness_evaluation.m`.
1. Demos.


## How do I get set up? ##

## Where can I get help? ##

There is a `demos` folder inside the repository.
Further help is also available on the GitHub [wiki](https://github.com/fguerit/pps-toolbox/wiki).

## Changelog ##

Changes can be tracked in the [changelog.md](changelog.md) file.
